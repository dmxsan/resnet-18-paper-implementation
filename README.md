# ResNet-18 Implementation from Scratch

This repository is my personal project to implement ResNet-18 architecture in PyTorch, based on the original paper: </br>
**Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition (2015)**  </br>

## Goal
The goal is to understand residual learning by implementing ResNet-18 and training it on CIFAR-10. This repo will be regularly updated with code, training scripts, and insights.

## Setup
Install dependencies from `requirement.txt`

## Usage
Run the training script to train the model on CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Progress & Updates
This repo is actively developed as part of deepening my knowledge of convolutional neural networks and residual architectures.
